Monopoly Math is a work-in-progress mathematical simulation meant as a project entry for Singapore Math Society. It's based on the board game [Monopoly: Ultimate Banking](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/monopoly/ultimate-banking-game-rules.php), which is a little different than the original Monopoly. 

The point of the simulation is to mathematically analyse Monopoly: Ultimate Banking and determine how to best play the game to win as quickly as possible (i.e. which properties to buy, the best course of action when an event card is received, etc.).
