# Monopoly Math

Monopoly Math is a work-in-progress AI meant as a project entry for Singapore Math Society. It's based on the board game [Monopoly: Ultimate Banking](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/monopoly/ultimate-banking-game-rules.php), which is a simpler and faster-to-play version of the original Monopoly.

The AI uses an adapted minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, and its purpose is to maximise its chances of winning the game.
