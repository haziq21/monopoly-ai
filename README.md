# MCTS for Monopoly

This repo contains a simulation of [Monopoly: Ultimate Banking](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/monopoly/ultimate-banking-game-rules.php), which is a simpler and faster-to-play version of the original Monopoly board game. This repo also includes a Monte-Carlo Tree Search AI to play the game. The simulation and AI were part of a project entry for the Singapore Math Project Festival.
